# Detecting rain in satellite radard altimetry measurements

## context

For those unfamiliar with satellite radar altimetry, let's just say that we send an instrument (called an altimeter) in space. This instrument sends a radar wave towards the Earth surface and waits for its reflection to come back. A precise clock on board measures this two way travel time which can be converted to a distance.

In practice satellite radar altimetry is a bit more complex, but this simple description is enough to understand the context and motivation for this study.
