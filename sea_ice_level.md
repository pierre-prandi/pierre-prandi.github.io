Hey !

Thanks for your interest in my work !

Unfortunately I wasn't able to attend the Living Planet Symposium, so the poster might feel alone a little.
In case you got any questions, please mail me at pprandi@groupcls.com

For general information on our current work at CLS (supported by CNES) on satellite radar altimetry for polar monitoring, [here](https://groupcls-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/p/pprandi/EUUacqUjg6VHqxeqpy4YCG8Bnh1PSxVac-Y-yrTBRmUx0Q?e=CeZvRw) is a presentation I made in the last Li√®ge Colloquium on Ocean Dynamics.
At the same meeting, Matthis Auger, gave a [more specific talk](https://groupcls-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/p/pprandi/ET0CkRsnE5ZBlaasFN8XGd8BPj65hitYK1dxApJKy_oDRw?e=HPFhfA) on multi altimeter combination in the Southern Ocean.
